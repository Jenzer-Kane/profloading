NOTES: 
functioning authorization, separation of dean and faculty modules, design is clean,
simple to understand, fully functional, 


MORE:

NEW FEATURE (++):
MAKE ADMIN MODULE? (asides dean and faculty, not sure if still within scope of study)

DEAN MODULE
ADD (+):
+ option to import subjects? (button, etc)
=> mass import from excel file, not singular

+ greedy algorithm, if nasetan na yung subject, di na sya magiging available 
and mag auto-select sa next unset subject sa professor, 
=> if specific professor has assigned subject, other professors should not be able to see assigned subject to specific professor

(di ko lang sure kung tama yung logic, what if the subject is taught more 
than once in a week / or let it not exceed more than 2 times in a week)
=> subject must not exceed 3 hours per week (good)

+ sched change request viewer / handler (chatbox or change requests are on 
colored dropboxes like sa changes made in a github repo before commit)
=> just like ThinkBitSolutions contact page, user interface (modal) and new admin page for viewing/altering inquiries from users (professors)

+ Gayahin yung layout ng COR? or ng orig na Teacher's Program (PENDING)

FIX (-): 
- Nagreredirect sa Add Course page after mag set ng
sched sa schedule table
==> should redirect back to current schedule of the current professor

-  no schedule to be displayed sa homepage after mag finalize ng 
sched for prof and sinelect sya sa homepage
==> should redirect back to current schedule of the current professor
